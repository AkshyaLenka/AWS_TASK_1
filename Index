AWS Task-1

ðŸ”… Create a key pair 

ðŸ”… Create a security group 

ðŸ”… Launch an instance using the above created key pair and security group.

ðŸ”… Create an EBS volume of 1 GB.

ðŸ”… The final step is to attach the above created EBS volume to the instance you created in the previous steps.

So this task is all about familiarizing with the AWS CLI which is a nice tool for executing AWS tasks.

Note:

1. All the commands are executed using command prompt.

2. First log in to your aws account by using â€˜aws configureâ€™ command.

Here are the steps for completing these tasks:

1. Create a Key pair

command: aws ec2 create-key-pair --key-name key01

Here â€˜key01â€™ is the key name that we want to create.

2. Create a security group 

Command: aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name secure1 --description "My security"

Here â€˜secure1â€™ is the name of my new security group, you can give other names too.

3.  Launch an instance using the above created key pair and security group.

Command: aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-0e306788ff2473ccb --instance-type t2.micro --count 1 --subnet-id subnet-50737a38 --security-group-ids sg-03c83b778c27acbb6 --key-name key01

We can get the â€˜security-group-idsâ€™  in the cmd screen after creating the respective security group. Subnet-id refers to the availability zone.

Our instance is successfully Launchedâ€¦â€¦

4. Create an EBS volume of 1 GB.

Command: aws ec2 create-volume --availability-zone ap-south-1a --size 1

Here size should be in GiB.

So , our new volume is created.

5. The final step is to attach the above created EBS volume to the instance you created in the previous steps.

Command: aws ec2 attach-volume --device /dev/sdf --instance-id i-07820b2a99739ead9 --volume-id vol-01638a8549ca2b4ec

We can get the â€˜volume-idâ€™ in the cmd output after creation of the volume.

Finally we have attached the newly created volume to our instance.
